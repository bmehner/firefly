# firefly

This is my bot for Robocode.

Currently it is a simple bot. It has a decent tracking algorithm, a reasonable bullet dodging and targeting. 
Nothing fancy, just some basic geometric stuff. It is able to kill all the bots that come with robocode.

It's name is inspired by the TV series [Firefly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_%28TV_series%29)
